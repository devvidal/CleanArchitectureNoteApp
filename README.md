# Documentation

## 📄 Overview
This application allows users to **create**, **edit**, and **delete** notes.  
It is built using the **Model-View-Intent (MVI)** architecture, following **SOLID principles** and **Clean Code** practices to ensure high maintainability and scalability.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Hilt**  
  Used for dependency injection, enabling modularity and easier testing.

- **Jetpack Compose**  
  Used for building a modern, declarative UI.

- **Kotlin Flow & Coroutines**  
  Utilized for asynchronous programming and reactive state management.

- **Room**  
  Employed for local data persistence, providing an abstraction over SQLite.

## 📦 Architecture Highlights

- MVI pattern ensures a unidirectional data flow and clear state management.
- SOLID principles promote clean, modular, and extensible code.
- Reactive patterns using Flow/Coroutines improve responsiveness and efficiency.
